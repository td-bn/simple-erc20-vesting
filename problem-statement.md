Problem:
Create a contract (vesting + token) with a token (XYZ token, 18 decimal ) supply of 100 Million.

Admin/token deployer can enter upto ten addresses where the token will disperse evenly for
12 months. Token release schedule will be per min.

Hint: Developers can use the OpenZepplin library to complete the solution efficiently.

Bonus: If the developer can create some basic UI to show the interaction of contract and UI,
then it would be a bonus point
